Mining programming languages and graphing them by their paradigms

## Usage
Run the **miner.py** File with Python3 to reproduce the graph :)

It will output the total number of programming languages examined that contained a paradigm.  
There will also be total number of programming languages. Unfortunately this number will be inaccurate due to the broken template "ProgrammingLanguage" provided by DBpedia that mismaps entries.
